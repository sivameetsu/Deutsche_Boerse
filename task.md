Task:

    Utilize IaC solutions like ansible and terraform to fully automate the deployment process of a small application described below.
    Please make sure that the solution you deliver is reusable: 
       it is important that the code should be easily modified by your colleagues to deploy other modules or components.
 
Python application:

    1. Write a python application that displays interesting Chuck Norris jokes from API[https://api.chucknorris.io/].

    2. Use official vanilla alpine-linux [https://hub.docker.com/_/alpine/] as base image from Docker Hub.
    3. A webserver (e.g. apache, nginx) should be deployed as proxy.
    
Expected deliverables:

    1. All your files and scripts should be located in a private repository (BitBucket, GitHub, etc.)
    2. Include a README file, to explain your solution. 
    3. Include a manual on using your code.
    4. Do not provide pre-built docker images.
 
Please keep in mind:

    1. If you chose to use any public code, please mention this. Provide links to used code.
    2. Even if you will not be able to finish the task, please provide what you have already made.
